        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am a current undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am in the Biochemistry department with a concentration in Biological Sciences. My current aspirations after graduate involve going into Graduate programs to work my way through a PhD. Using the wealth of knowledge, I will be gaining from obtaining the PhD I hope to someday run a research lab of my own. However, that is not all I want to do. I also plan on giving back to the communities that allowed me to pursue my career by giving back. My community in Los Angeles allowed me to apply to undergraduate school and they are the reason that I am here today. As for the type of research I want to work on. I am still not fully one hundred percent sure about the field I want to specifically enter, but I do want to go into immunology. These programs teach you everything that will allow you to learn more about the importance of transmissions and care. Especially when we think about the fact that everyone has a different body and will thus react and control pathogens to different levels and extents. 
<br><br>

        For more on my story through undergraduate to far:
<br><br>

        While I had just barely made it into the undergraduate as a first-generation student who was afraid of failure above all, I have learned a lot about myself and the world through my experiences. I discovered many social and personal misconceptions that had great importance to my personal development, such as diversity and inclusion. I come from a very conservative community that is predominantly Latinx/Chicanx or black, and significantly traditionalist in its nature. Upon leaving my community and beginning my college career, however, I learned to accept myself as gay and a part of the LGBTQIA+ community. While this discovery may seem small or insignificant to some, it has greatly impacted the development of my identity. Collectively, I believe that my experiences and self-discoveries made along the way thus far have shaped my identity as a social reform activist, an inquisitive scientist, and excellent leader. With these characteristics, I hope to accomplish all of my academic and career goals; to work hard and earn a PhD, to run my own research lab, and to work toward providing the same direction and inspiration to future generations in the same way that my mentors have done for me, because without their push during my high school career I would have never gone to college.
